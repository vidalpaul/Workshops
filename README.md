# BWS Blockchain Workshops

## Introduction

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **BWS** Blockchain Workshops. This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for back-end engineers at **BWS**, facilitating the acquisition of essential skills for blockchain integration tasks. Our workshops are meticulously structured to provide both theoretical understanding and practical application of blockchain technologies in our projects.

## Repository Structure

Each workshop in this repository is organized into two distinct branches:

    Initial State Branch: This branch contains the starting materials, code, and resources necessary for participants to begin the workshop. It sets the groundwork for the learning objectives and tasks to be accomplished.

    Final State Branch: This branch represents the end state of the workshop, including completed code, solutions to exercises, and additional annotations. It serves as a reference for the expected outcomes and integrates best practices for blockchain development.

## Navigating the Workshops

    Selecting a Workshop: Navigate through the list of workshops and select the one relevant to your learning path or current task.

    Initial State Branch: Start with the initial state branch of the selected workshop. This branch includes a README with an overview of the workshop, learning objectives, and setup instructions.

    Participation and Practice: Follow the instructions and engage with the tasks and exercises. Utilize the resources provided to enhance your understanding.

    Final State Branch: After completing the workshop or for reference purposes, switch to the final state branch to review the comprehensive solutions and additional insights.
